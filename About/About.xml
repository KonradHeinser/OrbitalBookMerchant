This mod adds an orbital book merchant who travel all over in search of knowledge to store and sell. This orbital trader sells a large numbers of books along with a few techprints, and have the silver to buy any books you're willing to sell.

For those who want more specific details, they sell 5 techprints along with 5-10 of each category of book (text book, scematic, novel, and tome (if you have Anomaly)).
